Garbage Wastes, exactly as it says, is a region covered in big lumps of trash and spare metals. It´s quite alive though, and the terrain seems to hint that it have been shaped 
by the junk itself. It´s a very good region conceptually, but playing it is a pain in the neck. I despise it as much as my neighbors.
If this place existed it would have been called The Second Chernobyl.
