Shaded Citadel is an interesting region. This place didn´t use to be like this--dark and crawling with spiders, in fact it was a religious place. It only got so dark after a massive
structure was built besides from it, blanketing the region in shadows, something that its residents had tried so hard to prevent. A very sad story if you ask me.
But as much fondness I may have for this region´s story, I have got to admit the predators are annoying as hell. Especially the Coalescipede--invincible, yet it can kill you. How awful.
