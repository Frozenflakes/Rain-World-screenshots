The Exterior is only but a part of a massive structure, which is identified as its own region likely to make mapping of the real deal a bit less huge.
There's a pretty big spike in difficulty regardless of whether you come from, the creatures are subtantially more aggresive and you might encounter creepy, unnatural things that make gross squishy
sounds as they move further on. Beware the Miros Birds, too!
