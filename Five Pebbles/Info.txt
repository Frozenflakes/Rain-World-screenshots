This region is a scam. There are no "Five Pebbles", and all I got was the so-called "mark of communication" from some enigmatic, talking puppet. They might have said something else,
but it didn´t really register as I was too busy swallowing their pearls (they told me I could have them!) and doing acrobatics. Puppet seemed nice though, even wished me good luck, I´m not
sure for what but it was very cool of him. I might come back. The flying color-changing things were tasty, too...
