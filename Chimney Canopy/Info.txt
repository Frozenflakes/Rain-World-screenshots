Chimney Canopy? More like Vulture Canopy amirite. 
I don´t know what to say for this one, it´s pretty just almost like Industrial Complex but there are death pits. This place can be a short depending where you come from;
from Five Pebbles is easy, just beeline to the right until you see a karma gate. Be careful with how you jump though, and check if the shadow of a vulture appears when entering a room.
If you come from the lower section of Chimney however... May god be with you. Unless you´re playing as Monk, there´s almost nothing!
