Shoreline is a vast ocean. The water is a little green, but nonetheless not as much as our previous guy (Garbage Wastes). It´s not all swimming, though! It has small islands and 
platforms that you can jump on; those very same platforms direct you to an underground facility? tunnel? where you can rest in. It´s a very pretty region in my opinion, andI like it too
for how easy it is to traverse. Tons of food aswell.
Here you can meet someone very interesting, too.
